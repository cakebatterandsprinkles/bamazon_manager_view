## Bamazon: Customer View

:curly_loop: This node app uses a MySQL Database. Managers are prompted about the action they want to take when they run the program:

  * The options are listed below:

    * View Products for Sale
    
    * View Low Inventory
    
    * Add to Inventory
    
    * Add New Product

    * Exit

  * If a manager selects `View Products for Sale`, the app lists every available item: the item IDs, names, prices, and quantities.

  * If a manager selects `View Low Inventory`, then it lists all items with an inventory count lower than five.

  * If a manager selects `Add to Inventory`, the app displays a prompt that will let the manager "add more" of any item currently in the store.

  * If a manager selects `Add New Product`, it allows the manager to add a completely new product to the store.

  * If a manager selects `Exit`, it stops the program.
